- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kamil aka @Marasz. Currently I'm trying to get fluent in modern programming languages. Despite the fact I'm scarce on time, I have to admit I'm quite a quick learner :)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in IT and Science news
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some basic stuff, like: Bash, HTML -> CSS ->JS, PASCAL etc
